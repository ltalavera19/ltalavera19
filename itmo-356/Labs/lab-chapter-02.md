# Chapter 02 Labs

## Activity 1

Most of the popular and functional pieces of software you use everyday involve Free and OpenSource. Choose 2 case studies from [https://highscalability.com](https://highscalability.com "High Scalability") and write a review of the company's architecture based the listed items.

You can find them at [https://highscalability.com/blog/category/example](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example "Case Study Examples")  or look on the High Scalability website on the lower right hand side for the "All Time Favorites" header to find some of the more popular services.   It's best to find a company that you use or support.

Answer these questions (not all of the Answers are in each case study!)

1. What market does that company serve? (What do they do?) And have they always served that market?
1. What Operating System(s) are used?
1. What programming languages/frameworks are used?
1. What storage and what database technologies are used?
1. What Opensource license is the technology stack licensed under?
1. What is the current stock price and what was the IPO of the company? (if traded publicly.)
1. What major obstacle (cost, system performance, QPS, etc, etc) was the company trying to overcome by implementing this technology stack?
1. What can you learn from this article relating to technology and infrastructure?

## Activity 2
