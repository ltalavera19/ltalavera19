## Where I am from
I am from right here in Chicago.  I live in Bronzeville about 5 minutes from IIT.  I do live very close to the school.  I have lived here for 4 years.  I was born in the city but grew up in Indiana and have lived in Chicago size I was 15.  
## IT Interests
Ever since I was little I always had in interest in computers or anything technological.  I was always the one that my family went to when they did not understand how to do something on anything technologcal they had.  Anytime we could get something new such as a speaker system, new computer, new car, or even new phones I was always the one who was so excited to teach everyone how to use it.  I was also always the one to set it up for eveyone to use and explain how it worked the best way I could.  I consider myself to be somewhat of an Apple nerd especially since everything I own is an Apple product.  But I am highly interested in the development of operating systems such as the systmes that people interact with on a daily basis.
## My First Computer
My first comptuer was actually an iPad 4th Generation.  My dad bought them for me and my younger sister for Christmas when I was around 9 or 10 years old.  I was increadibly excited especially since I never expected to get one.  I used it for almost everything I did.  I think that is what might have sparked my interst in technology and Apple as a comapny and the products that they make.  
## Something Intersting About Me
I really enjoy playing volleyball and I also did play in High School.  I am also really interested in cars.  That is somethinig that me and my dad talk about a lot and like what cars are good and bad in our opinion.  My favorite brand of cars is Volkswagen.
